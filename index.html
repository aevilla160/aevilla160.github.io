        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
        Hello! I am Alex Villa, an undergraduate student at the University of California, Merced.
        I am currently majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, with a minor in Applied Mathematics.
        My main research interests are in Collective Communication (MPI, NCCL), GPU Offloading, and data parallelism. 
        My academic career has spanned many areas and locations, allowing me to explore a wide range of topics and areas of study.
